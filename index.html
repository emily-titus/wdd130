        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ my whole lofe. 
        One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Nephi 31: 20
    </p>
    <p>
        "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, 
        having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.
        Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, 
        and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."
