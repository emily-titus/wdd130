    <p>Hello! This is my second semester at BYUI, my major is computer science. 
        I'm the oldest of 7 and I have two dogs, Oreo and Hobbs. I have several hobbies that I have bounced between through the years. 
    I've done painting, jewelry, embroidry, pottery, reading, games, and a few others. My most recent hobby that has been taking over my brain is crochet.
    I've been learning since march of 2023 and I've really enjoyed it. My favorite thing to make is little plush animals and I have been working on writting my own patterns.

        Back to school stuff, I really like BYUI because of the people, the standards, and that there is no homework due on sundays. 
    I think it's good to take a web design class because so much of the world is online now that being able to work it better can be very useful. 
    I have been thinking about setting up a website to sell some of the stuff I make and this class might be good for learning the basics.

        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. 
        One of my favorite scriputres is Helaman 5:12. Be strong in the face of adversity. 
        Thanks for looking at my page and I'm looking forward to getting to know my classmates.
