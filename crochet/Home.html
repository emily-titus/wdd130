        Hi! I’m Emily and I’ve been crocheting for a little over a year and a half. I know sometimes it can be confusing when starting 
        to crochet, trying to find a project to do or when you forget some of the basic stitches and where to find tutorials for new skills. 
        With Crochet Time, I’m hoping to provide  a little place to help you as you are getting started. On this site you can find some of 
        my favorite beginner stitches as well as a simple pattern. It’s a little mushroom that can be made with a variety of yarn sizes and 
        colors. My favorite type of crochet projects are called amigurumi, These are little plush animals or fun things that are 3D and 
        filled just like this mushroom. I hope you have fun with this project and I wish you well on your crochet journey!
