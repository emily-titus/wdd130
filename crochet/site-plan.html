        [Hi! I’m Emily and I’ve been crocheting for a little over a year and a half.
         I know sometimes it can be confusing when starting to crochet, trying to find a project to do or when you forget some of the basic stitches and where to find tutorials for new skills. 
         With Crochet Time, I’m hoping to provide  a little place to help you as you are getting started. 
         On this site you can find some of my favorite beginner stitches as well as a simple pattern.
        It’s a little mushroom that can be made with a variety of yarn sizes and colors.
         My favorite type of crochet projects are called amigurumi, These are little plush animals or fun things that are 3D and filled just like this mushroom. 
        I hope you have fun with this project and I wish you well on your crochet journey!]

        [Single Crochet
        To start a single crochet, you must first make a foundation chain so you have somewhere to work from. Then, you insert the hook under the top loop of the chain that is 2nd from the hook. Then you will yarn over and pull up a loop. Then, you yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook. This is one single crochet. 
        Slip Stitch
        Typically, slip stitches are used to fasten off a project or to create a border. To create a slip stitch, insert your hook into the next stitch, then yarn over and pull through the only loop you have on your hook. 
        Invisible Decrease
        To do an invisible decrease, you insert the hook into the front loop only of the next two stitches. So, you should have 3 loops on your hook right now. Yarn over and pull through the first two loops. Yarn over and pull through the 2 loops left on the hook.
